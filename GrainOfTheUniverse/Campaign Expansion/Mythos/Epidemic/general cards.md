Epidemic set: Delay damage dealing - mainly for spreading Infection

• Asymptomatic: Put Asymptomatic in your threat area. At the end of your turn, reveal a token from the chaos bag. If it’s a special token except bless, then all the investigators you have been in the same location with this round become Infected. If a bless token is drawn,  remove the bless token from the bag. 

• In your face: If you are not Infected, this card gains surge. Otherwise, choose one investigator at your location or a connecting location. This investigator becomes Infected.

• Sore Throat: Test Fight (3). If you fail, take 1 damage. If you are infected, this damage is direct.

• Uncontrollable Cough: Test Feet (3). If you fail, take 1 horror.  If you are infected, this damage is direct.

• Rising Fever: Test Will (3). If you fail, lose 1 resources. If you are infected, lose 3 resources instead. Flavor text: Medicines are so expensive these days!

• Newfound Confusion: Test Book (4). If you fail, you cannot investigate in the next round. Flavor text: Where am I? Who are you?
